#Cross Computation of Multidimensional matrices is a form of calculation with similar valued matrices and produces the fastest way possible to evaluate them. 
#This equation is useful when you are evaluating similar forms of data input with enormous volume, incalcuable in real time by parallel processes and linear processing
